# Summarize a PDF using chat gpt and python

Check out this incredible project! I have developed a command-line application that harnesses the power of Chat GPT-3 and Python to perform a variety of amazing feats, including:

Converting an example.pdf file to an example.txt file and removing all pesky images
Slicing the text into bite-sized chunks for easy reading
Summarizing these chunks to extract the most important information
Merging all of these chunks into a cohesive summary
Creating key notes based on this summary for easy reference
Developing a step-by-step guide to help guide you through the material
Distilling the bare essentials of the book into an easy-to-digest format
Writing a captivating blog post based on the notes
Generating mid-journey prompts to engage and excite readers with stunning illustrations
With this groundbreaking technology at your fingertips, you'll be able to streamline your workflow, save valuable time, and delve deeper into the text than ever before!
